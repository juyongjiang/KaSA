Please choose the correct answer to the question: Ethanol is a type of alcohol made from plants. Sugarcane and corn, which are both used in foods such as cereals and breads, are used to make ethanol. Burning ethanol provides a clean source of energy because the products of ethanol are water and carbon dioxide. Therefore, mixing ethanol with gasoline reduces harmful waste products. In the 1970s, many Brazilians drove cars with engines that used an ethanol gasoline mixture. This alternative fuel conserved the limited supply of gasoline available at that time. In the 1990s, gasoline became cheaper than ethanol, and Brazilians returned to driving more gasoline-fueled cars. Recently, Brazilians started driving more cars that use an ethanol-gasoline mixture. Ethanol is a good alternative fuel because it

Some of their theories were correct; some were later proven incorrect. One theory was that Earth was the center of the universe and that other planets circled Earth. The Greeks thought Earth did not move because its movement was not obvious from the surface of the planet. The Greeks also believed that an invisible sphere surrounding our planet contained the stars. This sphere rotated, explaining the apparent movement of constellations over time. Early Greeks also developed theories about the relationship between the moon and Earth. Why is the same side of the moon always visible from Earth?

Answer1: The far side of the moon does not reflect sunlight. Answer2: The moon stays in one location while Earth revolves around it. Answer3: The period of rotation and the period of revolution for the moon are about the same. Answer4: The moon rotates clockwise on its axis while Earth rotates counterclockwise on its axis.
