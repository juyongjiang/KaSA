To protect this bacteria while cleaning the filter, do not throw away used filter pads until they are absolutely falling apart. Instead, swish them around in a little dechlorinated water to remove any dirt and debris, and put them back.

Please choose the correct solution to the question: To make Belgian waffles

Solution1: In a large bowl, stir together two tablespoons of self rising flour, 3/4 cup white sugar, and 3 3/4 teaspoons baking powder with a balloon whisk. Separate two eggs by cracking the shells on a flat surface, gently prying the broken shells apart, letting the whites slide through your fingers into one bowl while holding the unbroken yolks in your hand, to place in another bowl. Beat the yellow egg yolks together with a whisk, and add 1 1/2 cups milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1 cup melted butter. Whisk. Add the wet mixture into the dry mixture and whisk again. Use a stand mixer with the whisk attachment fitted to whisk the whites until they hold firm peaks, standing straight up when you remove the whisk. Using a silicone spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the flour mixture by placing one spoonful of egg whites at a time into the bowl, lifting some of the mixture over the whites and repeating this gently until the whites are completely mixed in and the mixture is light and fluffy. Take great care not to 'crunch' the mixture, pushing out air.

You may have to use duct tape. Once the top is secured to the hose, attach the hose to your vacuum’s exhaust port. It’ll blow up your inflatables in no time. To deflate, attach the hose to the vacuum port and suck the air out.

Please choose the correct solution to the question: Make the best tasting lemonade you've ever tried.

Solution1: Only use fresh lemons, a dozen for a 2 litre pitcher is perfect. Use only filtered water, no chlorine etc. Using a lemon squeezer or juicer, extract the fresh juice and pour into your 2 litre pitcher along with your favorite sweetener to taste, and fill with pure water. The water is what makes this lemonade taste so good. No after taste or chemical flavours to spoil it.

Solution2: Lemonade can be made using vinegar and sugar, if you run out of lemons. With enough sugar you can't really taste the difference. It might need some yellow food colouring to make it look "lemony", which is quite important because the visual impact of food can rival the impact of the taste of the food itself.

Solution1: You'll need fabric dye in separate bowls and rubber bands. Take your fabric and bunch/twist it wherever you want the pattern or color. These can be small or large. Then secure each twisted bunched fabric with a rubber band and dip into the desired color or use more than one color for added effect. Let the fabric dry and when you eat the bunches of grapes the patterns will remain including sunbursts, rings and random interesting variations. Food coloring works until you wash the fabric, it is not permanent.

Please choose the correct solution to the question: Is there a best way to blow up party balloons?

Solution1: Before a birthday party or other affair requiring large numbers of inflated balloons, it is helpful to have a dozen or so blowers arrive early. Give each one a handful, depending on how many you need, and then return to the kitchen to continue getting food ready. At least one person will know how to do it right, so they will all eventually figure it out.

Solution2: Invite 10 or 12 kids over half an hour before the party starts. With them watching, blow up a couple of balloons but tell the kids  they aren't allowed to touch them. Then, leave a box of pins on the table and say "and don't touch these either" very clearly. Leave the room until you hear the popping sounds.  When you come back in, tell them if they want balloons at the party they're the ones who have to blow them up. You'll have a roomful in about 10 minutes flat.

Solution1: 1.    In a small saucepan, melt butter  and cheese over medium-high heat.        2.    Continue to cook over medium-high heat; an even layer of white milk proteins will float to the surface.        3.    Bring to a boil; the milk proteins will become foamy.        4.    Lower heat to medium and continue to gently boil; the milk proteins will break apart.        5.    As the butter gently boils, the milk proteins will eventually sink to the bottom of the pot, and the boiling will begin to calm and then cease. Adjust heat as needed to continue boiling off the water without scorching the milk solids.        6.    Once boiling has stopped, pour butter through a cheesecloth-lined strainer or through a coffee filter into a heatproof container to remove browned milk solids. Let cool, then transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate until ready to use. Clarified butter should keep for at least 6 months in the refrigerator.

Please choose the correct solution to the question: How to clean your computer keyboard keys?

Solution1: Keeping the computer keys clean can extend the life of your lap top or desk top. If you don't clean the keys, the symbols can eventually become hard to read and you may find you are making many silly typing errors, just because you cannot read the keys. Spray the corner of a rag with windex, or vinegar, and wipe carefully until you can see the symbols clearly again. If the symbols have worn completely away, you can paint them on again with nail polish.

Solution2: You can get tiny letter stickers that just stick on the computer keys, and you may never have to bother again with windex or vinegar. The F keys are usually tricky, as they are so small, however you can place or tape a cardboard sign above these ones, that indicates what each one should be.
